JSEnigmaMachine
===============

A Enigma Machine emulator in made in JavaScript.
The emulated encryption is done by 3 rotors. At each position of a rotor you can choose from 5 different rotors and 26 different startingpositions, currently you could use each of the 5 rotors multiple times.
I haven't implemented a plug-board.
